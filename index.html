    <h2>Motivation and design approach</h2>

    <p>Creating pure SWT interfaces is often a headache since it is hard to follow up what is happening in the
        code if you have a complex UI tree. </p>

    <p>Yes, you can divide the code into thousand methods, but it still does not make it easier to focus on the
        functional part if you have so much ui-generating code.</p>

    <p>There are some very innovative approaches to fix this problem (before all others - GroovySWT). This project
        goes one step further since it does similar thing while you still stay in Java without the clutter of UI
        code, which is migrated to the JSON files (extension *.gui by default). </p>

    <h2>Simple example</h2>

    <p>Let's say you plan to make a simple username/password form with a single button to accept. If you wish to use
        SGT, you need to make 2 files: java code file <code>com.foobar.MyForm</code> and GUI definition file in the
        same package (with identical name as the form class): <code>com/foobar/MyForm.gui</code></p>

    <p>First you define the interface (either manually or using editor). Note: the correct filename is MyForm.gui,
        but for the sake of syntax highlighting by Github's Gist I appended the "json" extenion.</p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/2708850.js?file=MyForm.gui.json"></script>

    <p>Then you need only to define the class. Be aware though that there is much more noise in the example below
        then it will be in real program - I wanted to present a fully functional example.</p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/2708850.js?file=MyForm.java"></script>

    <p>Finally, this is what you get when you run the code:</p>

    <div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/shot.png"/></div>

    <h2>How to download and try it</h2>

    <p>This project is published as a Maven artifact so you can just go ahead and include it in your
        Buildr, Maven, Ant/Ivy build config:</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/2708850.js?file=dependency1.xml"></script>

    <p>If you wish to play with the GUI interactive editor you can download it and run it also
        via single dependency:</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/2708850.js?file=dependency2.xml"></script>

    <p>The repository where this artifact is deployed is:</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/2708850.js?file=repo.xml"></script>

    <p>Since Eclipse doesn't really like to use Maven to store SWT artifacts (at least for now)
        if you are not able to fetch Maven artifacts please install them locally manually.
        I know it's not a popular approach but there's nothing I can do :)</p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/2708850.js?file=installSWT.cmd"></script>

    <p>I propose using debug artifacts since it allows you to do so much more in debug mode
        in you IDE than normal artifacts! Of course in production mode do pack the non-debug version
        besides the jar of GUI Transformer. This is the approach used in Eclipse's testing Maven
        repository used in the POM of the project - although it is not up to date with latest
        stable SWT version - not by a long shot.</p>

    <h2>Little more details</h2>

    <p>As you have already maybe seen, SGT fact uses JSON input files as definition of the UI Shell and generates
        all of the components for you.</p>

    <h3>Accessing widgets</h3>

    <p>You can access all the components in the UI either</p>

    <ol>
        <li><p>by asking for them using their name (something similar to the Servlet attribute/parameter approach
            for accessing)
            using <code>net.milanaleksic.guitransformer.TransformationContext.&lt;*widgetClass*&gt;getMappedObject(*widgetName*)</code>
        </p></li>
        <li><p>or using annotation <code>net.milanaleksic.guitransformer.EmbeddedComponent</code> in your form class
            to have the component
            injected for you (approach based on dependency injection pattern)</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>In my opinion, first approach is useful for the cases when you wish to execute a simple and small action,
        like setting a <em>dynamic</em> text in some component (e.g. web service version fetched from far away).
        Second approach is useful when you wish to maintain reference to the widget throughout the life of the form
        (e.g. you need to keep reference to username/password text widgets until the user clicks on OK).</p>

    <h3>Event handling</h3>

    <p>No, you don't need to attach event listeners by yourself, SGT takes care of that (unless you wish to do
        something really complex which I did not cover, in which case you need to read the part "Accessing
        widgets").</p>

    <p>The way to handle automatic event listeners is based on injection and widget naming. If you give your widget
        a name
        then you can include a field of type <code>org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Listener</code> and annotate it with
        <code>net.milanaleksic.guitransformer.EmbeddedEventListener</code> or, in case you wish to use the same
        event listeners
        for multiple events from multiple widgets (or same event type from multiple widgets or different event types
        from same widget - I think you got the picture), use annotation
        <code>net.milanaleksic.guitransformer.EmbeddedEventListeners</code>.</p>

    <h2>Project dependencies</h2>

    <p>SWT GUI Transformer depends on following frameworks/libraries:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>(of course) <strong>SWT</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Google <strong>Guava</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Jackson</strong> - fastest JSON parser
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>javax.inject</strong> provider (for example Google Guice or Spring)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you don't use these libraries than you might need to fork the code
        and try to hack your way through.</p>

    <p>JRE required is 1.6.0</p>

    <h1>Interactive editor</h1>

    <p>Editor is a tool that should allow you to quickly change existing or make new GUI files. While you type
        you will be able to see changes immediately, or an error message (the thin red line at the bottom of the
        window) on which you can click to see the stack trace.</p>

    <p>
        <a href="images/editor.png" rel="lightbox" title="Interactive editor for SGT">
            <img src="images/editor_mini.jpg"/>
        </a>
    </p>

    <p>To run the editor, you have 2 options:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>checkout the project and <code>mvn package</code> - you will get executable
            <code>swt-gui-transformer-editor-{version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar</code>,
        </li>
        <li>download the assembled artifact from the github page.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you wish to open GUIs that use <strong>additional shortcuts</strong> for classes, you need to add to the
        classpath of the editor the output jar/dir of your project.</p>

    <p>Editor is a tool that should allow you to quickly change existing or make new GUI files. While you type JSON
        definition of the interface you will be able to see changes immediately, or an error message (the thin red
        line at the bottom of the window) on which you can click to see the stack trace.</p>

    <p>Editor uses Guice 3.0 as the DI container (required dependency).</p>

    <p>For specific syntax details of the GUI files please take a look at the
        <a href="documentation.html">documentation page</a>.</p>
